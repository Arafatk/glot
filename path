Make runtime polymorphism with 1,2,3 dimensions



Function operator only for 1 dimenion
Handling multiple lines within the same plot.

Functions
1. Bubble Line Linepoints  7 other types of line plots for one dimensional work
2. Reset the whole plot
3. Axis setting
4. Interface cases within the same functions for different dimensions and erros incase they
are not supported
5. Histogram and smooth sinx cos x curve
6. A 2d function with y as a func of x and a 3d function with z as a func of x,y
7. Fill
8. Logarithmic scale
9 Scatter
10. Contours Beautiful 3d surfaces built with functions

Interface
Just a function with a set of values that can be implementted by literally any time
of thing so the actual implementation depeneds on the type calling it.

None of our required functions really have a return value but just an error is returned at best.

Make an interface with different values and do reflect typeof to find the types.





Make a plot struct with map between names and curves

Make an inaccesible variable called dimensions that helps you identify your dimensions
at a time and give errors accordingly and make functions.

Have a reset function

Have a fixed set of supported data types by the interface and have them typecasted to float64
always

Add an optinal parameter for debug value

Remove and add curve to a plot using map
Finally the plot button will plot your stuff

Set curve style method
Set curve axis method
Just take the name of the curve and set the styles and everything

Always have defaults and set by user

Add functional curve method to add curves with functions
Remove curve is the same


Add bubble curve
Add boxplot
Add other types also
reset curve will reset the values of a curve given its name
delete curve will remove the curve
Add check later if the slice is a perfect matrix
Add a typecasting process later
